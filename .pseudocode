Read through the fucking docs. Don't follow along yet, just READ.

Each of these models needs an entry

The media model needs to support images, video, and audio

Calendar model, views, calendar.html should be imported from sjsDjango (provided it jives with this version)
Templates (index and secondary) need to be created
Each page needs a views entry
URLs need to work (regex?)
